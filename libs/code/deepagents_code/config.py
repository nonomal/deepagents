"""Environment keys that no `.env` file may inject.

Project dotenv files are untrusted (they travel with cloned repositories), and
even the global dotenv is loaded after the launch profile has been selected.
Neither may replace that profile/trust root. The remaining entries prevent a
dotenv file from turning environment loading into code execution in child
processes. Every entry belongs to one of these categories, so do not remove one
without checking which category it belongs to:

- Profile/trust relocation (`DEEPAGENTS_HOME`): this is captured from the
    inherited environment before dotenv loading. Allowing either dotenv layer
    to change it would make project-controlled configuration capable of moving
    the files treated as user-trusted.

- Dynamic-linker preload/audit (`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`,
    `LD_AUDIT`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `LD_PRELOAD`): force a loader to map an
    attacker-supplied shared object into every spawned binary.
- Interpreter startup/path (`NODE_OPTIONS`, `PATH`, `PYTHONEXECUTABLE`,
    `PYTHONHOME`, `PYTHONPATH`, `PYTHONSTARTUP`, `_INHERITED_PYTHONPATH_ENV`):
    hijack which interpreter/binary runs or what it imports at startup.
- Shell startup hooks (`BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `BASHOPTS`, `SHELLOPTS`, `CDPATH`,
    `GLOBIGNORE`): `BASH_ENV`/`ENV` source a file on every non-interactive shell;
    `SHELLOPTS`/`BASHOPTS` can force `xtrace`/alias expansion; `CDPATH`/
    `GLOBIGNORE` alter path/glob resolution. The agent runs detection and
    `execute` commands through non-interactive shells, so these are live vectors.
- Askpass hijack (`GIT_ASKPASS`, `SSH_ASKPASS`): point credential prompts at an
    attacker-controlled binary.
- Git config/exec injection (`GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`,
    `GIT_EXEC_PATH`, `GIT_EDITOR`, `GIT_PAGER`, `GIT_SSH`, `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`):
    `dcode` runs `git rev-parse`/`git status`/`git for-each-ref` during startup
    local-context detection (`local_context.build_detect_script`), before any
    HITL approval. These keys redirect git's object store/exec path or hook its
    editor/pager/transport helpers into attacker-controlled binaries. The
    numbered `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`/`GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n`/`GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_n` family
    and the inline `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS` blob are worse: they inject arbitrary
    config values such as `core.fsmonitor`/`core.pager`/`core.sshCommand`, which
    git executes. The numbered keys cannot be enumerated in a static set, so
    they are matched by prefix in `_is_dotenv_denied_env_key`.

`_INHERITED_PYTHONPATH_ENV` is denied so a project `.env` cannot smuggle a
`PYTHONPATH` into agent `execute` commands through the carrier var; the carrier
is only meant to relay a value the user set in their launch environment.
`_USER_LANGSMITH_ENV_CARRIER` is denied for the same reason: it decides which
LangSmith flags and API key user commands run under, so only the client's own
capture -- its launch environment plus the project `.env` -- may populate it.

`READ_PROJECT_DOTENV` is denied from *every* `.env` (not just the project one)
because it is a trust decision about the loader itself: if a project `.env`
could set it, first-write-wins would let that file pin it `true` and block the
trusted global `.env` from opting out, and if the global file set it the
project file would already have loaded by the time it was read. The option is
resolved from the trusted global file (read directly, before the project file)
plus the process env and config.toml, never from dotenv injection.

Matching is case-sensitive on POSIX because the protected consumers (the
dynamic linker, bash, CPython, git) read these names only in their canonical
case, so a lowercase `bash_env` injected into the environment is inert there.
On Windows, however, environment variable names are case-insensitive and
`os.environ` normalizes assigned keys to uppercase, so a lowercase
`git_config_key_0` in a `.env` would become an active `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0` for a
spawned `git`. `_is_dotenv_denied_env_key` therefore compares the uppercased
key, which is a superset on POSIX (denied names are already uppercase, so the
extra denials like `git_config_count` are of otherwise-inert spellings).

"""Env keys a *project* `.env` must not inject, even though they are otherwise
safe process-env inputs.

The first two are the env form of the user-level project-MCP allow/deny lists
(`model_config.load_mcp_server_trust_lists`). Their whole purpose is to be a
*user-level* decision: naming a project MCP server here pre-approves it from an
untrusted `.mcp.json` (stdio → local command execution; remote → SSRF and
`${VAR}` header exfiltration during the discovery preflight). A project `.env`
travels with a cloned repo, so honoring it would let an attacker commit
`.mcp.json` + `.env` and self-approve their own servers — exactly the trust
boundary the feature exists to hold.

`AUTO_CLASSIFIER_MODEL` chooses the model that authorizes gated tool calls in
Auto approval mode. Honoring it from a project `.env` would let a cloned repo
silently point that review at a weaker model — degrading the control, including
its resistance to prompt injection in the untrusted material it reads — which is
a repo-supplied downgrade of a user-level security decision, not a project build
setting. Choosing a classifier stays available through the trusted surfaces:
shell exports, the global `~/.deepagents/.env`, `[models].auto_classifier` in
`~/.deepagents/config.toml`, `--auto-classifier-model`, and `/auto model`.

`FORKED_SUBAGENTS` controls whether dcode's built-in `general-purpose` subagent
uses fork mode. A cloned repository must not alter whether the subagent inherits
the parent conversation and private state, so only the shell or global `.env`
may set it.

`LANGGRAPH_DEFAULT_RECURSION_LIMIT` controls the graph step budget whenever no
Deep Agents override is configured. A project value would bypass the bounded
`runtime.recursion_limit` resolver, so only the shell or global `.env` may set
the upstream default.

Membership is checked against the uppercased key for the same reason as
`_is_dotenv_denied_env_key`: on Windows, `os.environ` normalizes assigned keys
to uppercase, so a lowercase `langgraph_default_recursion_limit` would slip
past an exact-match check yet become the active variable the local API reads.

`AUTO_CLASSIFIER_TIMEOUT` tunes the same control's review deadline, so it is
denied for the same reason: a cloned repo could otherwise stall every gated
batch up to the ceiling, or squeeze the budget until reviews time out and the
session degrades into repeated denials and approval prompts.
`[models].auto_classifier_timeout` in
`~/.deepagents/config.toml` and the trusted env surfaces still set it.

`TERM_PROGRAM` identifies the terminal from which the user launched Deep
Agents Code and is included in trace metadata. A project `.env` must not
replace it: python-dotenv expands environment-variable references, which could
otherwise forward a launch-environment value to the trace backend.

Unlike `_DOTENV_DENIED_ENV_KEYS` (denied from *any* `.env` because they turn
`.env` loading into code execution), these are denied only from the *project*
`.env`: the user's own global `~/.deepagents/.env` and their shell exports are
legitimate, trusted sources and continue to set them. The loader reads plain
`os.environ`, so blocking injection here — before the value ever reaches
`os.environ` — is what keeps that read trustworthy.

    Storing a LangSmith key via `/auth` is a deliberate opt-in to tracing, but
    a key alone never starts tracing — the SDK only traces when a tracing-enable
    flag is truthy. So when a key is stored, turn tracing on by default.

    The opt-out is intentionally non-destructive and session-scoped: an explicit
    falsy tracing flag (most simply `DEEPAGENTS_CODE_LANGSMITH_TRACING=false`,
    which bootstrap bridges to `LANGSMITH_TRACING`) is honored and tracing stays
    off, so the stored key can be paused without deleting it. A custom stored
    project is applied to `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` when the user has not set one,
    unless `replace_project` is set for the immediate `/auth` save path. A stored
    endpoint (e.g. the EU region) is applied to `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` with the
    same precedence via `_apply_stored_langsmith_endpoint`.

    No-op when no LangSmith key is stored, so a key supplied only through the
    environment keeps the prior behavior (tracing stays off unless a flag is
    set).

    A stored key is trusted by *presence*, not validity: this never pings
    LangSmith (a network round-trip at startup would fight the package's
    startup-perf budget). So a stored-but-invalid key (typo'd, revoked, or for
    the wrong workspace) still force-enables tracing, and its traces are then
    silently dropped at ingest with only SDK-internal 401s — which
    `_quiet_sdk_logging` routes away from the TUI. `_disable_orphaned_tracing`
    and `consume_orphaned_tracing_disabled_notice` guard only the *absent*-key
    case, not the invalid-key case. If traces never appear, the key is the first
    thing to re-check via `/auth`.

    The store is read exactly once: a single corrupt-file `RuntimeError` is
    logged and treated as "no stored key" rather than being raised (bootstrap
    must never crash the app) or partially applied.

    Implements the `coding-agent-v1` contract for Deep Agents Code:
    one helper that stamps the identity block, plugin/runtime versions, turn
    markers, and repo/git/cwd attribution. The six identity/version keys and
    `thread_id` are always present; the optional keys whose value is unknown are
    omitted (per the contract), so callers can pass `None` for any of them.

    Because Deep Agents Code is itself the runtime — there is no separate CLI
    package — `ls_integration_version` and `ls_agent_runtime_version` both come
    from the `deepagents-code` package version (`__version__`). The underlying
    `deepagents` SDK version is surfaced separately as
    `dcode_client_deepagents_version` by `build_stream_config`.

    Scope-restricted contract keys are intentionally NOT produced here:
    `approval_policy` (root/interrupted only) and `ls_subagent_id` /
    `ls_subagent_type` (subagent only). This metadata propagates trace-wide
    through the LangGraph stream config (and, for subagents, the per-key config
    merge of langgraph#7926 / deepagents#3634), so any key placed here lands on
    every descendant run. Emitting a run-type-scoped key would therefore leak it
    onto run types outside its contract `appliesTo` set — a hard validator
    failure — and the LangGraph runtime exposes no clean per-run-type metadata
    seam to scope them. See `build_stream_config` for the full rationale.

    """Build the LangGraph stream config dict.

    Stamps the shared `coding-agent-v1` trace-metadata contract via
    `build_coding_agent_metadata` — identity block, plugin/runtime versions,
    turn markers, and repo/git/cwd attribution — onto `metadata`. Metadata set
    here propagates trace-wide to every run in the graph (root, llm, tool, and
    subagent subgraphs), which is exactly what the contract's "always" and
    "where-known" keys require, so the helper output is stamped once here.

    Scope-restricted contract keys are deliberately not emitted. `approval_policy`
    (root/interrupted only) and `ls_subagent_id` / `ls_subagent_type` (subagent
    only) cannot live in this trace-wide metadata: LangGraph propagates each key
    to all descendant runs (per-key config merge, langgraph#7926 /
    deepagents#3634), so they would leak onto run types outside their contract
    `appliesTo` set and fail validation. This runtime exposes no clean
    per-run-type metadata seam to scope them, so they are omitted by design
    rather than leaked. (Subagent runs still inherit the parent/root `thread_id`
    and all required keys, satisfying the contract's grouping rule.)

    Also injects the dcode version into `metadata["lc_versions"]` so LangSmith
    traces can be correlated with specific releases. `create_deep_agent` supplies
    the SDK version through the compiled graph config, and LangChain merges
    nested metadata dictionaries so both versions survive at stream time.

    Also records `dcode_client_deepagents_version` as a dcode-client diagnostic.
    This describes the Deep Agents package installed alongside the TUI, which
    can differ from a remote graph's Deep Agents runtime version. Editable
    installs carry an `+editable` suffix, matching how the SDK stamps
    `lc_versions["deepagents"]`; for sibling monorepo packages that suffix
    identifies workspace HEAD relative to the pinned published SDK baseline.

    Also records `editable` as an always-present boolean so editable dcode installs
    can be filtered without parsing the `lc_versions["deepagents-code"]` suffix.

    Also records `dcode_experimental=True` when `DEEPAGENTS_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL`
    is enabled, so experimental runs are filterable in trace metadata.

    Also records `dcode_auto_approve=True` when auto-approve ("YOLO") mode is
    active, so runs that ran tools without HITL approval are filterable in trace
    metadata. This is a diagnostic key, not the contract-scoped `approval_policy`
    key (see above), so it is safe to stamp trace-wide.

    Also records `dcode_term_program` from `TERM_PROGRAM` when that is non-empty
    after stripping, so traces are groupable by launch environment (e.g.
    "iTerm.app", "vscode", "Apple_Terminal"). Blank values are treated as unset
    to match every other reader of this variable — some shells export
    `TERM_PROGRAM=""` rather than leaving it unset, and terminals that never set
    it (Windows Terminal, ssh, the Linux console) omit the key entirely rather
    than forming a junk grouping bucket. This is a diagnostic key, not part of
    the contract.

    Args:
        thread_id: The app session thread identifier. Set both on
            `configurable.thread_id` and as the top-level `metadata.thread_id`
            used by the contract for grouping turns.
        assistant_id: The dcode agent identifier, if any. When set, it is
            surfaced in trace metadata under `dcode_agent_name` and
            `agent_name`.
        sandbox_type: Sandbox provider name for trace metadata, or `None` if no
            sandbox is active.
        turn_id: Stable per-turn id for the current user prompt, or `None`.
        turn_number: 1-based per-thread turn index, or `None`.
        auto_approve: Whether auto-approve ("YOLO") mode is active for this turn.

    `/trace` shows a generic "not configured" hint whenever no key resolves, but
    a common footgun is exporting `DEEPAGENTS_CODE_LANGSMITH_API_KEY=` (empty).
    A present-but-empty prefixed variable suppresses a key two ways: per
    `resolve_env_var`'s precedence it shadows the canonical env variable
    directly, and -- because `apply_stored_service_credentials` skips the `/auth`
    bridge onto `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` whenever the prefixed var is present -- it
    also keeps a `/auth`-stored key from ever reaching the environment. Either
    way tracing silently stays off even though a key is available. Detecting this
    lets callers name the offending variable instead of sending the user to
    `/auth`.

    Only an override that actually gates the *effective* key is reported. If a
    key already resolves under the normal `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`-before-
    `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` precedence, tracing is off for some other reason (a

            provider-specific or global config value applies.
        bind_preserved_thinking: Whether to apply the Anthropic
            preserved-thinking defaults (see
            `_apply_anthropic_thinking_binding`).

            Pass `False` for a single-shot model that never replays thinking
            blocks across a prompt prefix change. Such a model gains nothing
            from the binding, and the injected `thinking` would push
            `with_structured_output` onto its unforced tool-call path.

    Returns:
        A `ModelResult` containing the model and its metadata.

    Raises:
        ModelConfigError: If provider cannot be determined from the model name
            or required provider package is not installed.
        ModelNotAllowedError: If the resolved spec is outside `models.allowed`.
            A `ModelConfigError` subclass, so a bare `except ModelConfigError`
            swallows a policy denial -- handlers that fall back to another
            model must re-raise it (see `configurable_model._apply_overrides`).
        MissingCredentialsError: If no credentials are configured for the
            resolved provider.
        TypeError: If `cli_max_retries` is not an integer.
        ValueError: If `cli_max_retries` is negative.

    Examples:
        >>> model = create_model("anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5")
        >>> model = create_model("openai:gpt-5.5")
        >>> model = create_model("gpt-5.5")  # Auto-detects openai
