"""Immutable filesystem paths captured before configuration is loaded.

`DEEPAGENTS_HOME` selects the user's profile and therefore a trust boundary. It
must come from the inherited launch environment, not from a project or global
dotenv file, and it must not move when the process changes directory or reloads
settings. `PATHS` is the single launch-time snapshot used by both the client
and the server subprocess.

This module also owns `classify_path`. `Path.exists()` returns `False` for some
permission errors, which makes an unreadable configured path indistinguishable
from one that has not been created yet. Diagnostics need that distinction, so
they probe with `Path.stat()` and retain an explicit `UNREADABLE` state.

Keep this module to the standard library plus `_home_error`, which has no
imports of its own. This module is imported on the CLI startup path and by the
server subprocess before heavier packages are needed.

    A profile root is a trust boundary that owns everything beneath it, so it

    the user did not mean:

    - The filesystem root, from `DEEPAGENTS_HOME=/` or a `..` chain that walks
      past it, would put credentials in `/.state/auth.json`.
    - The home directory itself, from a `DEEPAGENTS_HOME=~/` typo, would make
      the profile dotenv the user's generic `~/.env` and load it as trusted
      configuration.
    - An existing non-directory cannot hold a profile at all.
    - A root that exists but cannot be read. Every later access fails one file
      at a time, and each failure looks like a first run, so reject it once
      here with the real cause.
    - A symlink whose target is missing. The profile root is created lazily, so
      it would otherwise be created through a link the user cannot see.

    cased spelling of `/` or of the home directory is rejected too.
