"""MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools loader.

This module provides async functions to load and manage MCP servers,
supporting Claude Desktop style JSON configs. It also supports automatic
discovery of `.mcp.json` files from user-level and project-level locations.

Connection management is FastMCP's: one `fastmcp.Client` per configured
server, holding its transport, its auth, and — for stdio — a subprocess kept
alive across tool calls. Turning the tools that client discovers into
LangChain tools is `langchain.mcp`'s. What is left here is the part neither
owns: finding config files, merging them, resolving `${VAR}` references,
deciding which project-local servers may run at all, and reporting per-server
status to the TUI.

    Auto-discovers configs from standard locations and merges them. When

    Args:
        explicit_config_path: Extra config file to layer on top of
            auto-discovered configs.
        no_mcp: If `True`, disable all MCP loading.
        trust_project_mcp: Controls project-level server trust.

            Applies to stdio and remote (http/sse) servers alike — remote entries
            are gated too because an attacker-controlled `.mcp.json` can SSRF or
            exfiltrate `${VAR}` headers during the discovery preflight.

            - `True`: grant whole-config trust (all servers load).
            - `False` / `None`: no whole-config trust. `None` is treated
                identically to `False` — the persistent trust store this once
                consulted was removed, so project servers load only via the
                user's scoped approvals / env allowlist described below.

            Regardless of this flag, the user-level allow/deny policy
            (`[mcp].enabled_project_server_approvals`,
            `[mcp].disabled_project_servers`, and env equivalents via
            `load_mcp_server_trust_lists`) is applied: scoped approvals load
            from an otherwise-untrusted config only when the project root and
            server fingerprint match, and explicitly denied servers are dropped
            even from a trusted one.
        project_context: Explicit project path context for config discovery
            and trust resolution.
        additional_configs: Config layers injected by higher-level composition,
            such as plugin-provided MCP servers. Installing a plugin is treated
            as the user's trust decision for its bundled servers, so these load
            without per-server approval — but the user-level deny policy still
            applies (an explicitly disabled server stays disabled), and if that
            policy cannot be read the servers fail closed rather than bypass a
            saved rejection. A malformed layer (non-dict, or a non-mapping
            `mcpServers`) is skipped and surfaced as a config error.
        stateless: When `True`, do not return an owned runtime session manager.
        session_manager: Optional externally owned runtime session manager.

    Returns:
        Tuple of `(tools_list, session_manager, server_infos)`.
