    """Return the tool-call id the `/offload` hook dispatch runs against.

    Two requirements pull in opposite directions, and both are load-bearing:

    *Stable across resumes.* `ServerHooksMiddleware` folds this id into its hook
    `invocation_id`, and answering a hook request re-executes the operation
    **from the top** rather than resuming mid-coroutine. An id minted fresh here
    would therefore differ between the request and the resume, and
    `parse_hook_resume_value` rejects a mismatched invocation id as fatal ("the
    client answered a different request") -- which would break `/offload` for
    exactly those users who have a `PreCompact`/`PreToolUse` hook configured,
    and make the client's whole fulfill/resume loop unreachable.

    *Distinct across attempts.* The client memoizes fulfillments by
    `(snapshot_id, invocation_id)` for the session, and the hook `prompt_id`
    only rotates on user-prompt submit. A constant would make two `/offload`s
    within one turn collide and replay the first attempt's decision -- including
    a denial -- instead of re-running the user's hook.

    `configurable.checkpoint_ns` satisfies both, and
    `offload_api._execute_offload` is the invariant's owner: it derives the
    namespace as `dcode_offload:{operation_id}` from the client's per-attempt
    `operation_id`, which `RemoteAgent.aoffload` mints once and reuses across
    every resume round of that attempt. Changing either that namespace format or
    the client's reuse of `operation_id` breaks hook resume, silently, for hook
    users only.

    Returns:
        An id stable across this attempt's resume rounds and distinct from every
            other attempt's.
