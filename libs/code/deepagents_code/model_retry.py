"""Model-node retry middleware for the coding agent.

Wraps only the agent model node (not the whole agent turn) so transient model
connection failures are retried without re-running completed tool calls. Retry
counts are attached to constructed models upstream so runtime model switches
carry their provider-specific budget into each request. This module owns the
retry policy: which errors are transient, the backoff curve, and the user-facing
status surfaced while retrying.

Why not LangChain's `ModelRetryMiddleware`: it reads its retry count once at
construction, so it can't honor the provider-specific budget we stamp on each
model for runtime switches. It sleeps between attempts without saying
anything, which in a streaming terminal just looks frozen. When the budget
runs out it hands back an `AIMessage` containing the error text, so a dead
provider ends the turn disguised as a model answer. Its retry check only
inspects the raised exception, missing transport faults wrapped in exception
groups, and it jitters at 25% while ignoring `Retry-After` headers. None of
that is a knob; fixing any of it means overriding the whole loop, so we own
the loop here.
